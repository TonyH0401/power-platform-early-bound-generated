# Introduction

A collection of early-bound entities generated by `Early-bound Generator V2` on `XrmToolBox`. During entities generation, only select enities that are envolved within the process, for example, if your process envovles "Person", "Contact" and "Account", select those three entities only for generation.

Watch this video tutorial for the guide: https://youtu.be/WbbI4YcXA5M?si=D6yFSNWR7dIWd9VA. In the video, the person just imported several files but for sake keeping, import all of the files generated by the tool.

There will be an original setting file called `0_original-settings` but you can also generate a new one inside of the tool.

Each project will be stored inside folder and be named as followed `Solution Name` - `Application Name` - `Version (Optional)`.

- Each folder will have its corresponding `README` file, optionally.
